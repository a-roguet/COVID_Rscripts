# Preparation
### Set the working directory
OneDrive desktop has to be install on your computer. \
Once install, you will have to synchronize the SARS-CoV-2 folder to your files, to do that, you just have to create a shortcut of the SARS-CoV-2 folder. On your favorite browser, just right click on SARS-CoV-2 folder and click on "Add shortcut".  \
You are good to go :-)
```{r}
working_directory=here("~", "OneDrive - UWM", "SARS-CoV-2", "DATA", "ddPCR data")
```

### Set the run-ID
The run-ID is the name of the directory containing the amplification/cluster .csv files
It is important that folder start with: 
YEAR-MONTH-DAY space TARGET, such as 2021-1-24 for a N1N2 run performed on January 24, 2021
```{r}
run_ID = "XXXXXXXXXXX"
```

### Set the sample info
.csv name (in the folder)
```{r}
samples.info = "XXXXXXXXXXX.csv" 
N1.LOQ.No.droplet=10
N2.LOQ.No.droplet=10
```


\
\

# Process the ddPCR data 

### Import the functions
```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here(working_directory, run_ID))
source(here(working_directory, run_ID, "function_ddPCR.R"))
```


## Run analysis
```{r dplyr, stringr, data.table}
Analyse_ddPCR_results()
```
