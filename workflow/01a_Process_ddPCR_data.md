# Process ddPCR data

Adelaide Roguet 7-8-21



This workflow will show how to process the raw amplification and cluster data into concentrations and even more :-)

It describes: 

- How to download the last version of the scripts from Github
- How to process and analyze ddPCR data using R markdown
- The quality control step #1





## Before starting

1. Make sure the ddPCR data you are about to process are in the shared **ddPCR data** OneDrive folder, and named as such:
   > SARS-CoV-2 > DATA > ddPCR data > YOUR RUN
   
   
   
   > **Year** dash **Month** dash **Day** space **Target(s)**
> Good examples: 2021-2-23 N1N2 or 2020-12-3 N1N2
   > Bad examples: 2021-02-23 N1N2 or 20-12-3

   

2. If you ran a multiplex assay, make sure the .csv file (containing the metadata) exported BOTH **channel 1** AND **channel 2**. 
   For N1/N2 multiplex, you should have for each well, one line describing **N1** information and another line describing **N2**. For BCoV/BRSV multiplex, you should have for each well, one line describing **BCoV** information and another line describing **BRSV**.

   On Figure 1, the **good** file contains both N1, N2, BCoV and BRSV information. While the **bad** file only contains N1 and BCoV information (information related to N2 and BRSV are missing). If you observed such omission, just fix manually the .csv file (trying to re-export it from QuantaSoft never worked for me!). To do so (Figure 2), just copy and paste the green columns (the only ones read by R in the following step), and replace **N1** by **N2** and/or **BCoV** by **BRSV**. Done!

3. Make sure that the target(s) names are correctly spelled. 
   > Good examples: N1, N2, BCoV, PMMoV, BRSV
   > Bad examples: n1, n2, BCOV, BCV, PMOV, PMMOV, BRV, etc.


4. Make sure you don't have any "filler" samples. The amplification .csv file associated with these samples is empty. This will generate R errors during the analysis.




## Import the last R script from Github

1. Download the Github repository **COVID_Rscripts** located here [Github COVID_Rscripts.](https://github.com/AnehEf/COVID_Rscripts/)
    But you can click here to directly download the scripts:
    [Github R_scripts_download.](https://github.com/AnehEf/COVID_Rscripts/archive/master.zip)

2. Unzip the file, and copy the content of the folder **ddPCR** into the folder containing the ddPCR data you want to process

PS: Since only AR was updating the code, the scripts are also available in the folder **_code** in the **ddPCR data** folder



## Analyze the ddPCR data

1. Open the file **Process_ddPCR_data.Rmd** using RStudio

    

2. Change the **Run_ID** (Figure 3 #1). It is the name of the folder containing the ddPCR data:

    > **Year** dash **Month** dash **Day** space **Target(s)**

    

3. Change the **samples.info** (Figure 3 #2), it is the name of the .csv file (Figures 1 and 2)

    

4. Click on **knit** (Figure 3 #3). This option is also available here:

   > File > Knit Document

If everything is going well, this is what you should see in RStudio (Figure 4)

   **Figure 4.** The theme and the location of your pane layout must be different from my RStudio



Once the script has been run, RStudio should open an html file. You can open that file using your favorite browser. The file is located in your ddPCR run directory:

   > SARS-CoV-2 > DATA > ddPCR data > YOUR RUN

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15jQRHSq57SbByS3tD5wefNk-gQ7quR-Y/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
   **Figure 5.** This report allows you to quickly see what sample have been process, which target (a) and how many amplification files have been detected, and how many reactions have been properly processed (b).





## Quality control #1

1. On the html file that automatically opens at the end of the ddPCR process (see Figure 5 above), make sure the number of processed samples per target match the number of samples expected. 

   

2. Open **results_final.csv** (Figure 6). The columns you will need in this section are: **Flag.***, **Comment**, **NeedRerun**, **Sample**, **Target**, and **PositivesDroplets**.

   > It is in that file that we will report all bad samples, why we report them, etc.

   

3. **FOR EACH SAMPLE**, visually check (pdf plots):

   - For **singleplex**, the **split between the positive and negative droplets** on the 1D cluster plots.

   - For **multiplex**, the **correct cluster classification** on the 2D cluster plot. Something is incorrect, flag it (see point #8 below) (Figures 7-10).

     

4. If the clusterization (multiplex) is not correct, but it seems that it could be easily fixed, reprocess the raw data using a different parameter, i.e., changing in the csv file the target name. It will process the samples using different setting than can make the clusterization more successful. 

   > BCoV/BRSV to N1/N2
   >
   >  N1/N2 to N1s/N2s ("s" for sludge), etc.

   > BCoV/BRSV split is made by QuantaSoft. R is just reading BioRad's clusters. So, if the clusterization is wrong, don't blame Adelaide or the R package :-)

   

5. If the split/clusterization is bad because of a weird pattern, report "**weird pattern**" in the **comment** column and add "**need_rerun**" in the column **NeedRerun** (see point #5 below) (Figure 6).

   > It is most likely that weird patters are associated with too few accepted droplets (<10,000).
   
   


6. Check that **NTC are negatives** or **below the limit of detection** (2 droplets max). If not, then rerun the whole plate! No exceptions. Sorry :-(

   

7. More quality controls:

**For N1/N2:**

- Check the number of positive droplets for the standards 1:8. At least one of the two replicate should be ~100 droplets (80-120 droplets). No? Ask the person who did the plate if something could explain the high/low droplet number. If nothing can explain it, rerun the whole plate! Sorry :-(
- Check the concentration observed in the dupicate sample (if any) is the same than the one during the last run. Overall, I keep the value of the duplicate sample. I do not add "duplicate" in the "NeedRerun" column. But if you want to ignore that sample for that specific reason, add "duplicate" in the "NeedRerun" column

**For BCoV/BRSV:**

- Check that the concentration in the **BRSV only** wells are about the same.





8. If any of the points above have been violated or anything caught you eyes, report it in the **results_final.csv** file in the column **comment** and add **"need_rerun"** in the column **NeedRerun**. FOR MULTIPLEX ASSAYS, **do not forget** to report for both N1 and N2, BCoV and BRSV (Figure 6).

The library xxxx is not installed. To install it, just write in the R-console: install.packages("xxxx")
```

  ```
  It is most likely that you imported an empty amplification file. Did you imported a filler?
  ```

  

+ No error during the processing of the data, but on the html/report file, I can see that all/some of the detected amplification files have not been processed. 
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xm2O1q16vOvcyoM8vduIiGnRuzq7OO3Q/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
```
Check in the sample metadata .csv file that all the information are correctly entered, i.e., channel 1 and/or channel 2, target correctly spelled, etc.
```





- I have a sample with only negative droplets, while I'm almost certain it should be positive.
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XoyaWnmynvnkaF1-SPEQsimxRC5Kir3a/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

```
Check that the average amplitude of the negative droplets cluster is at the same levels that the NTC. If it is higher, then you may have too many positive droplets. Time to dilute your sample!
```
